## Brianna's Projects

### Lab 2: Space
The first project I am sharing is [Lab 2](https://github.com/MarconneBA15/MAGD150/blob/gh-pages/f18magd150lab02_Marconnet.zip). The space-themed lab's focus was basically on use of color and new shapes. Because of this, I freely experimented with the beginShape(); function to create the asteroid and bezier curves to create the strange green clouds on the planet's surface. After working on the previous lab in black and white, I put a lot of attention into working with color on this first opportunity and spent a lot of time creating a gradient of colors on several objects.
