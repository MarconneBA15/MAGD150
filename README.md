## Brianna's Projects

### Lab 2: Space
The first project I am sharing is [Lab 2](https://github.com/MarconneBA15/MAGD150/blob/gh-pages/f18magd150lab02_Marconnet.zip). The space-themed lab's focus was basically on use of color and new shapes. Because of this, I freely experimented with the beginShape(); function to create the asteroid and bezier curves to create the strange green clouds on the planet's surface. After working on the previous lab in black and white, I put a lot of attention into working with color on this first opportunity and spent a lot of time creating a gradient of colors on several objects. 

### Lab 4: Ocean
Next is [Lab 4](https://github.com/MarconneBA15/MAGD150/blob/gh-pages/f18magd150lab04_Marconnet.zip). For this one, I incorporated several interactive elements. With a key press, lightning will appear on screen; to do this, I set the boolean so that the lightning is the same color as the background when the key is not pressed but will appear in yellow when a key is pressed. Also, the turtle's position on-screen can be changed by dragging it, a bubble appears nearby the mouse when clicked, and a seastar is attached to the user's mouse as if it were the cursor. 

### Lab 5: Television
The television-themed [Lab 5](https://github.com/MarconneBA15/MAGD150/blob/gh-pages/f18magd150lab05_Marconnet.zip) brought my attention to creating interactive buttons. When the remote control's button is clicked, it turns red and the "OFF" text changes to "ON". Similarly, when the button on the console next to the TV is clicked, its text changes and it turns green. With a mouse click, the TV screen turns on to reveal a news channel and the small light on the face of the TV changes from red to green. Finally, I drew a detailed living room scene and randomized ellipses of three different colors appearing on the background. 

### Lab 7: Nature
[Lab 7](https://github.com/MarconneBA15/MAGD150/blob/gh-pages/f18_magd150_lab07_Marconnet.zip) is a fall scene with tree leaves and grass affected by the user's mouse movements. To create the shifting and rotating square of leaves, I used the transformations translate, rotate, and scale on the shape in order to make it respond to the coordinates of the mouse. The "blowing" strands of grass are PVector lines with various PVector functions applied to them. 

### Lab 9: Documentary
Lastly, [Lab 9](https://github.com/MarconneBA15/MAGD150/blob/gh-pages/f18magd150_lab09_Marconnet.zip) incorporates outside media in the form of images, videos, and audio files. The image at the top of the screen is set so that each time the mouse is clicked, a random new image of a cryptid will replace the last. The user's webcam is used for a live video appearing on the bottom of the screen behind some grass and with invert and posterize filters on top to make the user look like an alien.
